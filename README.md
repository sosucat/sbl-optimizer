Print pattern optimizer for ``Swell by Light (SbL)``.\
SbL is an approachable technique for freeform raised textures on paper and other materials. SbL-Optimizer improves print patterns considering heat diffusion, making the resulting swell patterns better match the original images.

````![A printed pattern's shades change as the optimization progresses, and the resulting temperature distribution gets closer to the intended pattern.](https://sites.gatech.edu/futurefeelings/files/2025/03/opt_step.gif)````

Optimization of the printed pattern results in a uniform temperature pattern closely matching the original pattern.

## Features

- **Adaptive heat‚Äêpattern optimization**  
  Compensates for heat diffusion to produce raised textures that match your design.
- **Simple CLI**  
  One‚Äêcommand execution, with JSON‚Äêbased configuration and image input.
- **Built on Python**  
  Uses NumPy, Pillow, and Matplotlib for computations and visualizations.

## Installation
Install `sbl-optimizer` in two easy ways:

### 1. (Recommended) From PyPI

```bash
pip install sbl-optimizer
```

### 2. From Source
Clone the repository and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sosucat/sbl-optimizer.git
cd sbl-optimizer
pip install .
```

### Requirements

Ensure you have Python and dependencies:
| Libraries  | Versions   |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Python     | 3.9 ‚Äì 3.11 |
| NumPy      | 1.24 - 2.2 |
| Pillow     | 9.5 - 11.x |
| Matplotlib | 3.7 - 3.10 |

You can also install dependencies manually if they were not installed automatically:

```bash
pip install numpy pillow matplotlib
```
---

## Quick Start

1. Run the optimizer with a sample image:

   ```bash
   sbl-optimizer
   ```

2. Locate the generated optimized pattern `sample_opt.pdf` in the current directory.

3. Check the simulated temperature distribution `sample_temperature.png` and swell pattern `sample_swell.png`.

4. Print the `sample_opt.pdf` on paper, apply paste, and expose to a strong LED spotlight. Darker printed regions absorb more heat and swell.

5. Try optimizing your own pattern.
   
   ```bash
   sbl-optimizer path/to/your_image.png
   ```

---

## Configuration

Some parameters can be customized via a JSON file (default: `config.json` shipped with the package).

`config.json`
```json
{
  "swell_temperature": 145.0,
  "light_power": 100.0,
  "light_diameter": 0.06,
  "alpha": 5e-07,
  "verbose": 1,
  "resolution": 120000
}
```

| Key                 | Type   | Description                                                   |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `swell_temperature` | float  | Target swelling temperature (¬∞C). Adjust this based on the swell temperature of the paste you have.                            |
| `light_power`       | float  | Light source power (W). Adjust this according to your light's power.                                      |
| `light_diameter`    | float  | Diameter of the light circle on paper (m). Adjust based on the light circle diameter during heating.                   |
| `alpha`             | float  | Thermal diffusivity of paper (m¬≤/s).                          |
| `verbose`           | int    | Bool enabling logging. 0: turned off; 1: turned on.           |
| `resolution`        | int    | Number of cells paper is divided into in thermal simulations. Reduce this for faster optimization. Increase for a finer result.|

To override defaults:

```bash
sbl-optimizer --config path/to/your_config.json <IMAGE>
```

---

## Command Line Interface

### Usage

```bash
sbl-optimizer [OPTIONS] <IMAGE>
```

### Arguments

  `<IMAGE>`\
  Path to the input image (JPG, PNG)

### Options

| Option                  | Description                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `-c`, `--config <FILE>` | Path to JSON config file   |
| `-h`, `--help`          | Show help message and exit |

---

## Examples

1. Use default settings on a sample image.
    ```bash
    sbl-optimizer
    ```

2. Use default settings on your image.
    ```bash
    sbl-optimizer flower.jpg
    ```

3. Use custom settings
    ```bash
    sbl-optimizer --config my_config.json
    ```
    , where ``my_config.json`` looks like this:
    ```json
    {
    "swell_temperature": 135.0,
    "light_power": 120.0,
    "light_diameter": 0.07,
    "alpha": 5e-07,
    "verbose": 0,
    "resolution": 50000
    }
    ```

Output files (in same folder as input image `sample.jpg`):

| File                      | Description                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `sample_opt.pdf`         | Optimized pattern to be printed.    |
| `sample_temperature.png` | Simulated temperature distribution. |
| `sample_swell.png`       | Simulated swell pattern.            |
